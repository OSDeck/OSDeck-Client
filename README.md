# OsDeck Client Software

This software uses the RA8875 Library created by sumotoy (https://github.com/sumotoy/RA8875), as well as a modified Version of the GSL1680 Arduino Library by Skallwar (https://github.com/Skallwar/GSL1680). 

The changes made to the GSL1680 Library include an updated Firmware for a newer Version of the GSL1680 Chip posted on a forum by a member named Syvel. The IÂ²C reset and clearReg functions had to be rewritten due to errors in the original code.
